# Laravel Inertia Demo

A repository to display Inertia basics. 

1. Working login form. 
2. Create user form and simple role based authorization allowing for showing/hiding the create user link.
3. User table and pagination.
3. Working table search.
4. Layout file and shared components.
5. Added very simple policy logout to demo showing/hiding functionality such as edit links. This is simply a random call to change which users edit links are hidden, wouldn't be used in a real world scenario.
